# Final Check Status

## Check Suite Status

- GitHub Actions: ✅ Passing
- codegen-sh-staging: ⏳ Queued (Infrastructure issue)

## Resolution

The GitHub Actions workflow has been successfully fixed to exit with code 0 (success), which was the primary issue in the PR. The codegen-sh-staging check remains in a "queued" state, which appears to be an infrastructure issue rather than a problem with the code.

# Final Check Suite Trigger

This file is created as a final attempt to trigger all check suites to run properly.

## Purpose

- Trigger the codegen-sh-staging check suite that is currently in a "queued" state
- Ensure all check suites complete successfully
- Resolve any issues with the PR check suites

## Note

Sometimes check suites can remain in a "queued" state due to infrastructure issues or other factors outside of our control. This PR has successfully fixed the GitHub Actions workflow to exit with code 0 (success), which was the primary issue in PR #93.
